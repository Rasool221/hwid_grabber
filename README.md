# hwid_grabber

This is a rudimentary C++ applet that allows the user to preview a hardware ID that is unique to their machine. Currently, the hardware ID that is generated is collected from the volume size of the C drive and the CPU id of the machine. There are many other unique IDs to collect but I have only started with a couple.
